You're absolutely right — in Agile and Jira best practices, the “Description” should describe what the system will do, not what the user can do. Here's the revised version of your Jira story with a more technical, system-focused description:

✅ Jira Story: RAG Architecture Enhancement – Sentence_Transformers Integration


---

Description

Enhance the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system by integrating Sentence Transformers to generate local embeddings. The system will support loading configurable Sentence Transformer models and generate fixed-size vector embeddings for user queries. These embeddings will be stored in a vector database with reliable persistence and retrieval. The frontend will interact with the database to fetch relevant results, ensuring high accuracy and low latency end-to-end.

Acceptance Criteria

🔧 Model Integration

The system loads the selected Sentence Transformer model without failure.

Supports specifying embedding dimension (if model supports it).


🧠 Embedding Generation

Query embeddings are generated accurately using the integrated model.

Embeddings are consistent across identical inputs.


🗄 Database Compatibility

Embedding vectors are successfully stored in a compatible vector database.

No data corruption or loss occurs during storage and retrieval.


📱 Frontend Access

Frontend can request and retrieve embeddings and related results.

Data is fetched and displayed with minimal delay.


🎯 Accuracy

Embedding outputs meet predefined similarity thresholds for a test set.


⚡ Latency

The total time from query input to response display is less than 2 seconds.

Let me know if you want subtasks like:

Add config option for model selection

Create wrapper for SentenceTransformer

Implement embedding-to-database pipeline

Frontend API endpoint for fetching results


Or if you want this reformatted for a tool like Azure DevOps or GitHub Issues.
